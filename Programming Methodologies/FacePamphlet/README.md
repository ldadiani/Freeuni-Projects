# FacePamphlet
I created a server program that keeps tracks of the information in the simple social network called FacePamphlet. The server manages all usersâ€™ profiles. A profile includes: the person's name associated with that profile, an optional image file name for a profile picture, an optional "current status" for the profile, and a list of friends for each profile.
