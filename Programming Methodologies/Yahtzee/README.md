# Yahtzee
The goal:
I created a computer version of the game Yahtzee. There are five dice and one to four players. A round of the game consists of each player taking a turn. On each turn, a player rolls the five dice with the hope of getting them into a configuration that corresponds to one of 13 categories. If the first roll doesn’t get there, the player may choose to roll any or all of the dice again(maximum three times).  If the dice configuration meets the criteria for that category, the player receives the appropriate score for that category; otherwise the score for that category is 0. Since there are thirteen categories and each category is used exactly once, a game consists of thirteen rounds. After the thirteenth round, all players will have received scores for all categories. The player with the total highest score is declared the winner.
'Yahzee' uses arrays in a variety of contexts to implement a popular multiplayer dice game. There are arrays for the dice, player names, player’s score, and even an array of arrays to handle the entire scorecard.
