# Hangman
This is a program that plays the game of Hangman. 'Hangman' serves two purposes. First, the program is designed to give you some practice writing programs that manipulate strings and files. Second, by extending the program using the graphical tools , I had a chance to work with multiple classes in a single
application.
When the user plays Hangman, the computer first selects a secret word at random from a list built into the program. The program asks the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the word is redisplayed with all instances of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any letters correctly guessed on previous turns. If the letter does not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess. The user keeps guessing letters until either (1) the user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word or (2) the user has made eight incorrect guesses. For each incorrect guess, a new part of a stick-figure is added to the scaffold until the hanging is complete.
