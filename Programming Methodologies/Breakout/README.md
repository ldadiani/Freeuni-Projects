# Breakout
This is the classic arcade game of Breakout. Really improtrant step in writing the task is to break the problem up into manageable pieces. That ball bounces off the paddle and the walls of the world, in accordance with the physical principlegenerally expressed as “the angle of incidence equals the angle of
reflection” . When the ball collides with the brick , the ball bounces just as it does on any other collision, but the brick disappears. 
The play on a turn continues in this way until one of two conditions occurs:
1. The ball hits the lower wall, which means that the player must have missed it with the paddle. In this case, the turn ends and the next ball is served if the player has any turns left. If not, the game ends in a loss for the player.
2. The last brick is eliminated. In this case, the player wins, and the game ends immediately.
The game is simply operating by the same rules : bouncing off walls, clearing bricks, and otherwise obeying the laws of physics.
