# PriorityQueue
This program helped me to step up to implementing my own data structure!
I implemented t the Priority Queue class, a variant on the standard queue that processes elements in order of relative priority. I explored two different approaches for the class implementation: the first one uses an array and the second, more efficient approach uses a binary heap.I also analyzed and wrote client code that uses my new data type, reflected on the tradeoffs in the two implementations as well as other alternatives.
Learning goals of the project:
1. implement a class according to a provided interface definition.
2. understand how code is written in the role of implementer and how that differs from code written in the role of client.
3. gain practice with pointers, dynamic arrays, and explicit management of memory using new and delete.
4. develop an appreciation for the need to be vigilant when working with memory and pointers.
5. identify tradeoffs in implementation options and to reason about how these choices impact the flexibility and efficiency of the data structure.
