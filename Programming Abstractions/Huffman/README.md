# Huffman
Thia is a program that uses the nifty Huffman coding algorithm to compress and decompress files. This program draws upon concepts from across the quarter including use of ADTs, recursive exploration, linked structures, trees, and streaming algorithms and leverages the powerful skills for effective development, testing, and debugging that I have built up.
Learning goals:
1. gain practice with constructing, manipulating, and traversing binary trees.
2. be able to synthesize a number of different data structures and algorithms to accomplish an important real-world task.
3. develop understanding of how compression algorithms take advantage of patterns and trends in data to allow for more space-efficient representation.
