# Boggle
The Boggle game board is a square grid onto which you randomly distribute a set of letter cubes. The goal is to find words on the board by tracing a path through adjoining letters. Two letters adjoin if they are next to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. There are up to eight letters adjoining a cube. Each cube can be used at most once in a word. 
I wrote a program that plays a fun, graphical rendition of this little charmer, adapted for the human and computer to play pitted against one another.
Main focus of the program is on designing and implementing recursive algorithms. At the heart of the program is a recursive function that finds words on the board,  for the human player and for the computer.
