# TrailBlazer
my goal was to implement several classic graph algorithms– including breadth-first search, Dijkstra’s algorithm, and A* search – as I built myown version of Google Maps.  This project gave me lots of practice in thinking about how to represent abstract concepts like graphs and paths in software, and how to use your understanding of those abstractions to develop the code. 
This program displays various road maps and allows users to find the shortest path between any two nodes. 
The window contains several controls. You can load world maps by selecting them from the drop-down menu and then clicking the "Load" button.
